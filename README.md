# Grapevine-inflorescence-architecture
This code contains all Matlab functions needed to calculate persistence barcodes, 
bottleneck distances for persistent homology traits, simulation for berry potential, 
and other geometric features used in the study described in:

Characterizing grapevine (Vitis spp.) inflorescence architecture using X-ray imaging: implications for understanding bunch density

Code is implemented by Mao Li (maoli0923@gmail.com, github:maoli0923).

A few remarks:

(a) The study was based on mesh.ply files from X-ray imaging.

(b) Computing persistence barcode needs to install Javaplex http://appliedtopology.github.io/javaplex/
